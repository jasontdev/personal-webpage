    What portfolio could be complete without a todo app?
    By no means production quality, but served as a great

# Obligatory Todo

What developer portfolio could be complete without a todo application?

how to build things in React and Firebase.
  
## The stack
- Front-end: React, Styled Components.
- Back-end: Firebase Auth and Firebase Realtime database.
- Hosting: Firebase Hosting.
